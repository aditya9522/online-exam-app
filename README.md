# Online Examination System

Developed a secure and efficient online examination platform using Python and Django. This project features user authentication, timed exams, automated grading, and real-time result generation. The system is designed with a responsive front-end and a robust back-end, showcasing my expertise in full-stack development, database management, and secure system design. Built with Django's powerful framework, the platform ensures scalability, performance, and an intuitive user experience for both exam takers and administrators.
